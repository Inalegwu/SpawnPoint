# Spawn Point
Starter Project For React Native Apps using Expo,Expo-Router and NativeWind<br>
*get up and running quicker*


### Why Spawn Point ?
To reduce the overhead of starting new React Native/Expo projects using my favourite tools.

I make a lot of starter to help myself when making projects and I keep them open so that someone else can find it and maybe find it beneficial and we can all share

If you use Electron, you can check out [Electrostatic]("https://github.com/Inalegwu/ElectroStatic")



### Genetic Make Up
What Packages/Features make up Spawn Point and what makes it different.
Aside from the obivious things like React and React Native and all that comes with that , these packages are the ones I've found myself using more and more in my personal projects and in client projects as well as well as some of the more cutting edge things to allow for better DX

[Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) + [React Query Kit]("https://github.com/HuolalaTech/react-query-kit"): For server state and almost TRPC like user experience for your API

[Axios](https://axios-http.com) : For you API instance and providing some light error handling and data parsing

[Legend State](https://legendapp.com/open-source/state): My state manager of choice for my projects, It was previously [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/) but I prefer this for how lightweight and adaptable it is

[Shopify Restyle](https://shopify.github.io/restyle): Helping developers create design systems in their applications.
